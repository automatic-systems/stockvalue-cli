## Features:
- Supports input from streams, or keyboard. Can be operated as a child-process, or as a stand alone utility in terminal.
- Supports output to json,csv or tabular format. Output choice can be choosen by command argument `---output [json|csv]` or are choosen automatically by this utlity considering where does the output goes. 

## Implemented:
- added, and wrapped `prompts` npm module, it now smoothly accepts multiline stdin stream as input.
- wrapped playwrite module to show indeication of some background activitties ont he terminal itself. eg. page.goto
- Added better error handling, also allows exiting of utlity when the stream ends in non-tty mode, skips iterations where error occurs
- `debug` `prompt` , `printer`. use DEBUG=* node . , to be very verbose
